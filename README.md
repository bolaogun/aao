The image presents a multiple-choice question and its solution, which is to express the decimal number 25 as a binary number (base two).

**Question and Options:**
The question is: "1. Express 25_(ten) as a number in base two."
The options are:
A. 10011_(two)
B. 11001_(two)
C. 11010_(two)
D. 11100_(two)

**Solution:**

*   The solution involves dividing 25 by 2 repeatedly and recording the remainders.
*   The steps are as follows:
    *   25 divided by 2 is 12 with a remainder of **1**
    *   12 divided by 2 is 6 with a remainder of **0**
    *   6 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of **0**
    *   3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of **1**
    *   1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of **1**
*   The remainders are read from bottom to top to obtain the binary representation.

**Answer:**
The correct binary representation of 25_(ten) is **11001_(two)**, which corresponds to **option B**.

**Diagram:**
The image contains a simple diagram within a light blue rectangular box, illustrating the step-by-step division process to convert 25 from base ten to base two. The diagram shows the division steps and the corresponding remainders on the right-hand side, enclosed in red rectangles.
The image presents a multiple-choice question and its solution related to algebra.

**Question:**
The question is "2. Find the value of $a^3 + 2ab^2 + b^3$, when $a=2$ and $b=-1$." It offers four possible answers:

A. 9
B. 11
C. 12
D. 13

**Solution:**
The solution is provided in a blue-outlined box below the question. The steps are as follows:

$a^3 + 2ab^2 + b^3 = (2)^3 + 2(2)(-1)^2 + (-1)^3$
$a^3 + 2ab^2 + b^3 = 8 + 4 - 1$
$a^3 + 2ab^2 + b^3 = 11$

The correct answer, **B. 11**, is circled in red next to the options.

There are no diagrams in the image; it consists solely of text presenting a mathematical problem and its step-by-step solution.
The image presents a multiple-choice question with a mathematical problem and its solution. The question is:

**3. Find the truth set of (n ⊗ 4) ⊕ (n ⊗ 4) = 1(mod 5)**

The options are:

A. {0,2}
B. {3}
C. {2}
D. {1}

To the right of the question, there are two tables illustrating the operations ⊗ and ⊕ modulo 5.

Below the question, a light blue box contains the step-by-step solution to the problem:

*   **(n ⊗ 4) ⊕ (n ⊗ 4) = 1(mod 5)**
*   **Find two same numbers that after adding them gives 1(mod5)**
*   **So the only number is 3, because 3 + 3 = 6 which gives 1(mod5)**
*   **The value of n is 2**

The background of the image is white.

In summary, the image displays a multiple-choice question involving modular arithmetic, accompanied by tables illustrating the relevant operations and a detailed solution within a light blue box.
The image presents a mathematical problem and its solution, accompanied by a table illustrating the operation $\otimes$. The content is organized into three main sections: the problem statement, the solution, and the table.

**Problem Statement**

*   The problem asks to find the truth set of $n \otimes n = 4(\bmod5)$.
*   Four possible answer choices are provided: A. {1}, B. {3}, C. {2,3}, D. {2,4}.

**Solution**

*   The solution involves finding two same numbers that after $\otimes$ gives $4(\bmod5)$.
*   It is stated that the numbers are {2, 3} because $2 \otimes 2 = 4$ or $3 \otimes 3 = 4$, which gives $4(\bmod5)$.
*   The value of $n$ is determined to be {2, 3}.

**Table**

*   The table is a 5x5 grid with rows and columns labeled from 0 to 4.
*   Each cell in the table represents the result of the operation $\otimes$ between the row and column indices.
*   The table is colored in a gradient pattern, with darker shades indicating higher values.
*   Two specific cells are circled in red: (2,2) and (3,3), corresponding to the values 4.

In summary, the image presents a mathematical problem involving modular arithmetic and an operation $\otimes$, along with a table illustrating this operation. The solution identifies the truth set of the given equation as {2,3}.
